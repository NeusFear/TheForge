          <h1>Who Are We?</h1>TheForge started as a group of friends who liked to play games, simple enough. We had a vision to make a community of players that like to play the same games as us so we dont have that one guy in the squad who dosent know what they're doing and has their VOP Volume all the way down.<br><br>

          <h1>What is Our Goal?</h1>We want to make it easy for gamers to find games they'll love. On top of the community on discord you can ask, you can also consult our website, where we have reviews by REAL gamers, who arent biased or partnered with a huge company.<br><br>
